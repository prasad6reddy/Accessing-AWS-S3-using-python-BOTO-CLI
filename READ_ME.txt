By using this python code we can interact with the AWS S3 buckets through python BOTO CLI.

Developed a python script that allows the following operations on AWS S3
>>	Creation of buckets.
>>	Uploading the files into Specified bucket
>>	Downloading files to local instance
>>	Retrieves the list of Buckets present in the particular Region
>>	list the particulars of each bucket based on bucket name
>>	Moving the files to Glacier after a certain amount of time.

Install python BOTO CLI and run the code.
